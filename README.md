This is a C++ implementation of a command-line chess program that allows two-player play or play against a very primitive AI, complete with automatic save game and the option to load games from where they left off.
It must be run in a terminal set to display UTF-8, as it makes use of the unicode chess player characters to display the board. 

**It has only been tested in XFCE terminal in Linux. Optimal settings include dark text and light background, font size of 28.**
